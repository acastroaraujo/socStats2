Hi everyone, I will be uploading the homework questions to this website.

Feel free to reach out to me with *any* questions.

## Resources

These are my personal recommendations for resources to start getting interested in statistics. It's somewhat incomplete---e.g., there are no dedicated textbooks to causal inference, which is what we'll cover next semester.

**Class Resources:**

-   [The Effect](https://theeffectbook.net/) by NHK [@huntington-klein2021]

**Recommended (Short):**

-   General [@lundberg2021]

```
-   Introduction to DAGs [@rohrer2018; @cinelli2022]

    The [Causal Diagrams edX course](https://www.edx.org/learn/data-analysis/harvard-university-causal-diagrams-draw-your-assumptions-before-your-conclusions) by Miguel Hernán is pretty good too.

```
-   Don't interpret "control" or "adjustment" variables [@keele2020; @westreich2013; @hünermund2023].

**Good books to play around with:**

-   [Causal Inference: The Mixtape](https://mixtape.scunning.com/) [@cunningham2021]

    Covers a lot of the same ground as NHK, but has more math. It is also written by an economist.

-   *Counterfactuals and Causal Inference* [@morgan2014]

    I've been told many times that the first edition is better, so maybe try that one instead.

-   [Regression and Other Stories](https://users.aalto.fi/~ave/ROS.pdf) [@gelman2020]

    Chapters 18-21

-   *Theory & Credibility* [@ashworth2021]

**Advanced Resources:**

-   Mostly Harmless Econometrics [@angrist2009]

-   Causality: Models, Reasoning and Inference [@pearl2009]

-   [Causal Inference: What If](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/miguel-hernan/wp-content/uploads/sites/1268/2024/01/hernanrobins_WhatIf_2jan24.pdf) [@hernan2023]

    This gets used a lot in epidemiology.
