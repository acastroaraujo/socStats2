They can be any two variables you want and the treatment can be either binary or continuous, it shouldn't matter.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(gssr)\ngss2022 <- gss_get_yr(2022)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWhat is the \"naive\" estimate for the effect of $T$ on $Y$?\n\n### Exercise\n\n*Some theory.*\n\nThink very hard about the list of possible confounding variables that might affect this estimate.\n\n1.  Draw a DAG.\n2.  What is your estimand (ATE, ATT, ATU)?\n\n### Exercise\n\nSelect the appropriate covariates in the GSS that allow for causal identification.\n\nBe very careful when selecting these variables and make a note for any transformation you decide is adequateâ€”e.g., coding a covariate to be binary.\n\nAre there any variables missing from the DAG you drew earlier?\n\n### Exercise\n\nUse regression to get the effect of $T$ on $Y$.\n\n*Note. Remember that it's relatively straightforward to get the ATT using the `marginaleffects` package.*\n\n### Exercise\n\n*Weighting.*\n\nSpend some time trying to achieve covariate balancing. You should at least show a \"Love plot.\"\n\n*Note. Use any method you think is appropriate (e.g., propensity scores, CBPS, entropy balancing).*\n\n*What is the effect of* $T$ *on* $Y$*?*\n\n### Exercise\n\n*Double Robustness.*\n\n*Combining weighting and regression, what is the effect of* $T$ *on* $Y$*?*\n\n### Exercise\n\n*Write 3-5 paragraphs explaining your research question, the methods you used, and the answer you came up with.*\n",
