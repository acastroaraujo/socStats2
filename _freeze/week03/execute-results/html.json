I will be asking you to draw some DAGs. There are many ways to do this---e.g., [dagitty](https://dagitty.net/), [ggdag](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggdag/vignettes/intro-to-ggdag.html), [shinydag](https://www.gerkelab.com/project/shinydag/). I tend to use [this website](https://q.uiver.app/) and then copy-paste a screen shot of the result. You can use whatever you want (whatever is easier, including Word or PowerPoint if you must insist).*\n\n## Exercise\n\n*Ignorability*\n\nExperiments work because they make the distribution of potential outcomes the same across levels of the treatment variable. In other words, the potential outcomes and the treatment indicator are *independent.*\n\nThis is how this idea was introduced in class:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\nY^0 \\perp T, && Y^1 \\perp T\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nAssume the following table comes from perfectly executed experiment.\n\n| Group ($T$) | $E[Y^1]$ | $E[Y^0]$ |\n|:-----------:|:--------:|:--------:|\n|   $T = 1$   |  10,000  |    ?     |\n|   $T = 0$   |    ?     |  5,000   |\n\n: **Perfect Experiment Example\\*** {#tbl-experiment .stripped}\n\n[\\*30% of the population is in group T = 1]{style=\"color: #C5C5C5;\"}\n\n::: callout-note\n-   Fill in the missing cells.\n\n-   What is the ATE?\n:::\n\n## Exercise\n\nGo back to the glossary I asked you to start creating during Week 1.\n\nMake sure to add the following terms:\n\n::: callout-note\n-   *DAG.*\n\n-   *Paths.*\n\n-   *Direct effects.*\n\n-   *Indirect effects.*\n\n-   *Total effects.*\n\n-   *Front door paths.*\n\n-   *Back door paths.*\n\n-   *Confounding.*\n\n-   *Collider.*\n\n-   *Open Path.*\n\n-   *Closed Path.*\n:::\n\n<aside>See: @sec-glossary</aside>\n\n## Exercise\n\n*Drawing DAGs.*\n\n*The following exercises are [problems](https://github.com/NickCH-K/TheEffectAssignments) from NHK (Chapter 7).*\n\n::: callout-note\nDraw a causal diagram for the research question \"do long shift hours make doctors give lower-quality care?\" that incorporates the following features (and only the following features):\n\na.  Long shift hours affect both how tired doctors are, and how much experience they have, both of which affect the quality of care\n\nb.  How long shifts are is often decided by the hospital the doctor works at. There are plenty of other things about a given hospital that also affect the quality of care, like its funding level, how crowded it is, and so on\n\nc.  New policies that reduce shift times may be implemented at the same time (with the timing determined by some unobservable change in policy preferences) as other policies that also attempt to improve the quality of care\n:::\n\n## Exercise\n\n::: callout-note\nConsider this research question: Does the funding level of public schools affect student achievement for students in your country?\n\na.  What is the treatment and what is the outcome of interest?\n\nb.  Write down a list of relevant variables.\n\nc.  Which of the variables in your list in part b are causes of both treatment and outcome?\n\nd.  Why might we want to pay extra attention to the variables listed in part c?\n\ne.  Draw a causal diagram of the variables listed in part b.\n\nf.  Simplify the diagram from part e.\n:::\n\n## Exercise\n\n::: callout-note\nHow can a causal diagram be modified so as to avoid cyclic relationships?\n\nConsider the diagram below. It depicts a cyclical relationship between student achievement and motivation. If students achieve more (i.e., score well on exams), then their motivation goes up, and if their motivation goes up, they achieve more. Change the diagram so that the relationship is not cyclic anymore.\n\n$$\n\\text{Student Achievement} \\longleftrightarrow \\text{Motivation}\n$$\n:::\n\n::: callout-tip\nHint: We didn't see this in class, but you should be able to figure it out from the readings.\n:::\n\n## Exercise\n\n*The following exercises are [problems](https://github.com/NickCH-K/TheEffectAssignments) from NHK (Chapter 8).*\n\n::: callout-note\nAssuming that a path has no colliders on it, what is the difference between a path being Open and Closed?\n:::\n\n## Exercise\n\n::: callout-note\nConsider the below generic causal diagram.\n\n![](images/te-8.2.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"60%\"}\n\na.  List every path from X to Y.\n\nb.  Which of the paths are front-door paths?\n\nc.  Which of the paths are open back-door paths?\n\nd.  What variables must be controlled for in order to identify the effect of X on Y? (only list what must be controlled for, not anything that additionally could be controlled for).\n:::\n\n## Exercise\n\n::: callout-note\nWhich of the following describes a causal path where all the arrows point away from the treatment?\n\na.  Open Path\n\nb.  Closed Path\n\nc.  Front Door Path\n\nd.  Back Door Path\n:::\n\n## Exercise\n\n::: callout-note\nConsider the figure below, which depicts the relationship between teaching quality, number of publications (e.g., articles, books), and popularity among scholars and students in a population of professors.\n\n![](images/te-8.5.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"60%\"}\n\na.  What type of variable is Popularity in one path on this diagram?\n\nb.  Discuss what would happen if you controlled for Popularity.\n:::\n\n## Exercise\n\n::: callout-note\nGo to the app Steve showed us in class.\n\n<https://cbdrh.shinyapps.io/daggle/>\n\nSpend some time noodling around with it and upload screenshots with the right answer for three DAGs with 4, 6, and 8 nodes each. Set the complexity to \"difficult.\"\n:::\n\n## Exercise\n\n*House of DAG Simulation.*\n\nI've included a [little script](https://github.com/acastroaraujo/socStats2/blob/main/hod_simulation_functions.R) with a couple of functions meant to illustrate the connection between DAGs and the estimands we saw in class (ATE, ATT, ATC).\n\nSave it to your project and load it using the `source()` function.\n\nYou should see a function called `hod_simulation()` which creates a dataset that corresponds to the following DAG:\n\n::: grid\n::: g-col-7\n![](images/house-of-dag.png){width=\"100%\"}\n:::\n\n::: g-col-5\n-   $Y$: outcome\n-   $T$: treatment\n-   $U$: unobserved confounder\n-   $S$: affects selection into $T$\n-   $X$: affects $Y$ directly\n:::\n:::\n\nThe `hod_simulation()` function has the following arguments:\n\n-   `N`: Sample Size\n\n-   `rho`: The correlation between $S$ and $X$, it accepts values between -1 and 1.\n\n-   `Bt`: this is the treatment effect.\n\n-   `Bx`: this is the direct effect of $X$ on $Y$\n\n*Note. There's bunch of stuff going on under the hood, but we won't worry about that this week.*\n\nThis is the dataset it creates:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsource(\"hod_simulation_functions.R\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nStandard Error ~  0.322 \nPower ~  0.873\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nJoining with `by = join_by(variable)`\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 4 × 3\n  variable    sd  mean\n  <chr>    <dbl> <dbl>\n1 y        5.09  1.50 \n2 t        0.500 0.512\n3 x        1.00  1.07 \n4 s        1.01  1.02 \n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(12345) ## include this so that grading is easier for me.\nd <- hod_simulation(N = 1e3, Bt = 2, Bx = 4, rho = 0.8)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nStandard Error ~  0.405 \nPower ~  0.999\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nJoining with `by = join_by(variable)`\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 4 × 3\n  variable    sd  mean\n  <chr>    <dbl> <dbl>\n1 y        6.75   4.98\n2 t        0.500  0.52\n3 x        1.02   1.00\n4 s        1.01   1.02\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n*Note.
