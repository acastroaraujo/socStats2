## Exercise

*This question is copied from NHK's exercises. To answer this question you need to read sections 14.1 and 14.2 of [The Effect](https://theeffectbook.net/).*

*You want to know whether practicing cursive improves your penmanship (on a 1-10 scale). You find that, among people who don’t practice cursive, average penmanship is 5, 10 people are left-handed, 2 are ambidextrous, and 88 are right-handed. Among people who do practice cursive, 6 are left-handed with average penmanship 7, 4 are ambidextrous with average penmanship 4, and 90 are right-handed with average penmanship 6.*

You should probably represent the data in a better format, like this:

+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
|                      | Cursive (Treatment)  | No Cursive (Control) |

+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+

+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+

|                      | N = 4                | N = 2                |
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+

|                      | N = 100              | N = 100              |

### Part A

> You want to create a set of weights that will *make the treated group match the control group on handedness*. Follow the process in [section 14.2](https://theeffectbook.net/ch-Matching.html#weighted-averages), paying attention to *why* certain numbers are going in certain positions. What weights will be given to the left, ambidextrous, and right-handed people *in the control group*?

Since you want to make the treated group match the control group, all three weights for the control group are simply 1.

### Part B

> What weights will be given to the left, ambidextrous, and right-handed people *in the treated group*?

### Part C

> Use the weights from part b to calculate the *proportion of left-handed people in the treated group*, as well as the proportion of ambidextrous people and the proportion of right-handed people. If you don’t get 10%, 2%, and 88% (or very close with some rounding error), your weights are wrong, try again.

## A Lesson in Simulation

*Note. I will upload a fully worked out simulation learning experience when I get the time...*

Last week I was going to have you re-do something I found in @gelman2020 [pp. 385] that's supposed to build intuition about omitted variable bias and then compare it with results from simulations.

![](images/clipboard-874638397.png){fig-align="center" width="90%"}

It seems simple at first, but it's also misleading.

So, I changed things up a bit and added a simple toy DAG:

::: grid
::: g-col-4
![](images/clipboard-133306100.png){fig-align="center" width="100%"}
:::

::: g-col-8
$$
\begin{align}
&(1) &y_i &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \beta_2 w_i + \varepsilon_i, 
&& \varepsilon_i \sim \text{Normal}(0, \sigma_y^2) \\\\
&(2) &x_i &= \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 w_i + u_i, && u_i \sim \text{Normal}(0, \sigma_x^2)
\\\\ &&&&&w_i \sim \text{Normal}(0, \sigma_w^2)
\end{align}
$$
:::
:::

::: callout-tip
I expressed Equation (2) so that it would make sense to *generate* data from a simulation.

```{r}
fork_simulation <- function(N = 1e5, a0 = 1, a1 = 1, b0 = 1, b1 = 1, b2 = 1) {
  
  tibble(
    w = rnorm(N, 0, 20),
    x = a0 + a1*w + rnorm(N, 0, 2),
    y = b0 + b1*x + b2*w + rnorm(N, 0, 2)
  )
  
}
```
