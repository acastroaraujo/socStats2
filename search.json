It’s somewhat incomplete—e.g., there are no dedicated textbooks to causal inference, which is what we’ll cover next semester.\nClass Resources:\n\nThe Effect by NHK (Huntington-Klein 2021)\n\nShort:\n\nResearch questions and estimands (Lundberg et al. 2021)\nIntroduction to DAGs (Rohrer 2018; Cinelli et al. 2022)\nThe Causal Diagrams edX course by Miguel Hernán is pretty good too.\nDon’t interpret “control” or “adjustment” variables (Westreich and Greenland 2013; Keele et al. 2020; Hünermund and Louw 2023).\nThe effects of seemingly immutable characteristics (Sen and Wasow 2016; cf. Holland 1986).\n\nGood to play around with:\n\nCounterfactuals and Causal Inference (Morgan and Winship 2014)\nI’ve been told many times that the first edition is better, so maybe try that one instead.\nCausal Inference: The Mixtape (Cunningham 2021)\nCovers a lot of the same ground as NHK, but has more math.
