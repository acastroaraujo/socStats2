    "text": "Resources\nThese are my personal recommendations for resources to start getting interested in statistics. It’s somewhat incomplete—e.g., there are no dedicated textbooks to causal inference, which is what we’ll cover next semester.\nClass Resources:\n\nThe Effect by NHK (Huntington-Klein 2021)\n\nRecommended (Short):\n\nGeneral (Lundberg et al. 2021)\n\n\n\nIntroduction to DAGs (Rohrer 2018; Cinelli et al. 2022)\nThe Causal Diagrams edX course by Miguel Hernán is pretty good too.\n\n\n\nDon’t interpret “control” or “adjustment” variables (Westreich and Greenland 2013; Keele et al. 2020; Hünermund and Louw 2023).\n\nGood books to play around with:\n\nCausal Inference: The Mixtape (Cunningham 2021)\nCovers a lot of the same ground as NHK, but has more math. It is also written by an economist.\nCounterfactuals and Causal Inference (Morgan and Winship 2014)\nI’ve been told many times that the first edition is better, so maybe try that one instead.\nRegression and Other Stories (Gelman et al. 2020)\nChapters 18-21\nTheory & Credibility (Ashworth et al. 2021)\n\nAdvanced Resources:\n\nMostly Harmless Econometrics (Angrist and Pischke 2009)\nCausality: Models, Reasoning and Inference (Pearl 2009)\nCausal Inference: What If (Hernan and Robins 2023)\nThis gets used a lot in epidemiology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAngrist, Joshua D., and Jörn-Steffen Pischke. 2009.
